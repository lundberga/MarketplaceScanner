## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Node.js chosen over Python — discord.js 14 is dominant, single-language avoids orchestration overhead
- [Roadmap]: Tradera scraped before Blocket — API is more stable, proves Listing schema and dedup before fragile HTML parsing
- [Roadmap]: Vinted and Sweclockers deferred to Phase 5 — isolates highest-maintenance scrapers from core pipeline
- [01-01]: CommonJS throughout (no type:module) — discord.js 14 and better-sqlite3 work cleanly with require(); p-queue ESM deferred to Phase 4 dynamic import()
- [01-01]: pino selected as logger — structured JSON, production-ready, pino-pretty for dev
- [01-01]: dotenv.config() placed as absolute first statement in index.js before any other require

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Tradera sold-listing URL filter must be verified on the live site before coding the market-value path — if auth is required, sold-comps need an alternative source
- [Phase 3]: Blocket `__NEXT_DATA__` key name and listing object structure must be inspected from a live page before writing the parser
- [Phase 5]: Vinted Cloudflare behavior may require Playwright as a fallback — assess at Phase 5 kickoff
