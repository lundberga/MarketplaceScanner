## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Node.js chosen over Python — discord.js 14 is dominant, single-language avoids orchestration overhead
- [Roadmap]: Tradera scraped before Blocket — API is more stable, proves Listing schema and dedup before fragile HTML parsing
- [Roadmap]: Vinted and Sweclockers deferred to Phase 5 — isolates highest-maintenance scrapers from core pipeline

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Tradera sold-listing URL filter must be verified on the live site before coding the market-value path — if auth is required, sold-comps need an alternative source
- [Phase 3]: Blocket `__NEXT_DATA__` key name and listing object structure must be inspected from a live page before writing the parser
- [Phase 5]: Vinted Cloudflare behavior may require Playwright as a fallback — assess at Phase 5 kickoff
